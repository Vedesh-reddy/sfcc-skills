# CIP Starter Queries

Read only the section matching the custom analysis. Prefer a curated report
when it already answers the task. For sales interpretation/coverage, use
[Sales analysis](SALES_ANALYSIS.md).

Replace `Sites-Example-Site` with a verified natural site ID. Replace `<FROM>` /
`<TO>` with explicit inclusive dates before MCP execution. CLI `b2c cip query`
can replace them using `--from` / `--to`. Discover columns before adapting a query.
Date/site predicates bound the analysis; LIMIT only bounds returned rows.

## 1) Recent Daily Sales Snapshot

```sql
SELECT ss.submit_date, SUM(ss.num_orders) AS orders,
       SUM(ss.std_revenue) AS revenue

WHERE s.nsite_id = 'Sites-Example-Site'

GROUP BY ss.submit_date
ORDER BY ss.submit_date DESC
LIMIT 20
```

## 2) Sales by Site (Joined)

```sql
SELECT ss.submit_date, ds.nsite_id, SUM(ss.num_orders) AS orders, SUM(ss.std_revenue) AS revenue

JOIN ccdw_dim_site ds ON ss.site_id = ds.site_id
WHERE ds.nsite_id = 'Sites-Example-Site'

GROUP BY request_date, api_name, api_resource
ORDER BY request_date DESC, total_requests DESC
LIMIT 25
```
