> **Scope:** Deploy, download, and manage cartridge code versions on B2C Commerce instances. Use this skill whenever the user needs to upload or download cartridges to/from a sandbox, activate or delete code versions, watch for local file changes during development, or deploy a subset of cartridges. Also use when pushing code to an instance, pulling code from an instance, or setting up a dev workflow with live reload -- even if they just say 'push my code to the sandbox', 'download the code', or 'how do I activate the new version'.

# B2C Code Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI to deploy, download, and manage code versions on Salesforce B2C Commerce instances.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli code deploy`).

## MCP equivalent

Prefer `cartridge_deploy` for cartridge upload. Set `codeVersion` explicitly when
needed; `files` selects up to 100 local files (64 MiB total), relative to
`projectDirectory`, within discovered cartridges. Omit `files` for whole cartridges.
Matching remote files are overwritten; selected-file mode preserves other files.
`reload` may activate the target; keep upload success/warnings if reload fails.
Code mode `builtin/code-version-inspect` reads active/rollback and activation metadata;
`builtin/site-cartridge-inspect` reads site cartridge order and checks expected names.
SCAPI `dx/scripts/v1` provides version management; `site/sites/v1` manages site paths.
Use the CLI for watches, recursive downloads, and extra deployment flags.

## Configuration & Authentication

The CLI auto-discovers the target instance and credentials from `SFCC_*` environment variables (including project `.env`), the selected project-local or shared `dw.json`, and configuration plugins. `package.json` supplies only non-sensitive defaults. **Flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`, `--username`, and `--password` are usually unnecessary** — only pass them to override what's auto-detected.

Run `b2c setup inspect` to see the resolved configuration and which source provided each value (use `--json` for scripting; secrets stay masked by default). For precedence rules and troubleshooting, see `references/config/index.md`.

## Examples

### Deploy Cartridges

```bash
# deploy all cartridges from current directory
b2c code deploy

# deploy cartridges from a specific directory
b2c code deploy ./my-cartridges

# deploy to a specific server and code version
b2c code deploy --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# deploy and reload (re-activate) the code version
b2c code deploy --reload

# delete existing cartridges before upload and reload
b2c code deploy --delete --reload

# deploy only specific cartridges
b2c code deploy -c app_storefront_base -c plugin_applepay

# exclude specific cartridges from deployment
b2c code deploy -x test_cartridge
```

### Download Cartridges

```bash
# download all cartridges from the active code version
b2c code download

# download to a specific directory
b2c code download -o ./downloaded

# download from a specific server and code version
b2c code download --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# download only specific cartridges
b2c code download -c app_storefront_base -c plugin_applepay

# exclude specific cartridges from download
b2c code download -x test_cartridge

# mirror: extract to local cartridge project locations
b2c code download --mirror
```

### Watch for Changes

```bash
# watch cartridges and upload changes automatically
b2c code watch

# watch a specific directory
b2c code watch ./my-cartridges

# watch with specific server and code version
b2c code watch --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# watch only specific cartridges
b2c code watch -c app_storefront_base

# watch excluding specific cartridges
b2c code watch -x test_cartridge
```

### List Code Versions

```bash
# list code versions on the instance
b2c code list

# list with JSON output
b2c code list --json
```

### Activate Code Version

```bash
# activate a code version
b2c code activate <version-name>

# reload (re-activate) the current code version
b2c code activate --reload
```

**Note:** Activation is idempotent. If the version is already active, the command succeeds without making a change. If you've uploaded code or changed Custom APIs in the active version, use `--reload` with deploy or activate to force a refresh and register the endpoints. Check registration status with the `references/scapi-custom/index.md`.

### Delete Code Version

```bash
# delete a code version
b2c code delete <version-name>
```

### API Backend

`code list`, `code activate`, `code delete`, and the active-version discovery / activate / reload steps in `code deploy` run over SCAPI. Configure `shortCode`, `tenantId`, and the `sfcc.scripts` / `sfcc.scripts.rw` scopes and they work out of the box. Read scope (`sfcc.scripts`) covers `code list` / discovery; write scope (`sfcc.scripts.rw`) covers activate, delete, reload, and the `--activate` / `--reload` flags on deploy.

`code deploy` (file upload itself), `code download`, and `code watch` always use WebDAV — only the surrounding code-version operations use SCAPI.

OCAPI is deprecated and disabled on newer instances. `--api-backend auto` (the default) falls back to the OCAPI Data API on safe SCAPI capability/auth/request rejections; force a backend with `--api-backend scapi|ocapi` if needed. The `--reload` flag forces a code cache reload as activate(alternate) + activate(target), using whichever backend the command selected — so it works on OCAPI-disabled instances when SCAPI is configured.

### More Commands

See `b2c code --help` for a full list of available commands and options in the `code` topic.

> **Note:** `b2c code deploy` uploads cartridge _code_ to an instance. To manage which cartridges are _active on a site_ (the cartridge path), see `references/sites/index.md` for the `b2c sites cartridges` commands.
